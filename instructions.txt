This game plays similarly to Oregon Trail.

Type in the letter associated with an action, such as [C]ontinue meaning
that you have to type 'c' or 'C' to continue on in the game.

The game keeps track of 3 stats, all saved in the save.txt file, being
the number of men, the amount of gold, and the amount of food. If either
the men or the food levels drop to 0 or less you will get a game over screen
and be asked to either exit or restart the game from the beginning.

The easiest way to run the game so the art looks nice is to run it in
IDLE. I have play tested it in IDLE, the windows command prompt, and
PyCharm, all of these will work however PyCharm will stretch the ASCII
art and make it harder to play.

Nothing special has to be done when launching the file, simply open it
in IDLE and run the program. The art folder and all of the ASCII art
inside does need to be in there, however it won't crash the game if its
missing, just remove all of the art.

The save.txt file will be written over when a new game is started and after
each area is completed. It holds player stats and what areas the player has
already completed so that you can continue where you left off.
